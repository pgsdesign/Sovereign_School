# Sovereign_School
A suite of tools and procedures to help schools move toward a sovereign bitcoin based standard.

School on a Bitcoin Standard

The mission: in pursuit of both school and self sovereignty

Self sovereignty is the ability to control the direction of one's own life, and being the exclusive authority over one's own body and mind. Other synonyms for it are personal freedom, self determination, and liberty.

Donations

	OpenNode payments on public website linked to bank and Unchained for deposits
	Annual Fund - Parents, staff alumni etc donate on a yearly basis
		currently single sig with marketing and dev holding the wallet	

Payments - THIS IS MY HACKATHON PROJECT FOR NEXT YEAR!!!

	Currently parents pay with cash or check.
	
	Soon we will add the ability for parents to log into a PowerSchool SIS Parent Portal and pay (currently they can only fill out forms and see fees and balances). 
	Vanco/RevTrak is the credit card and web interface company. 
	Their stuff links to our current student information system in PowerSchool SIS. 
	The parent will get routed to their website for the credit card payment and then they fees are marked paid in PowerSchool SIS. 
	Need to incorporate a pathway for a Strike-like ability for parents to send the school dollars and we receive dollars
	We use the bitcoin rails to avoid the 3.9% fee from Vanco.
	
	Bounce to OpenNode option for folks that want to pay with SATs
	
	Maybe build our own "VANCO/REVTRAK" so we handle the whole thing and do the credit card on our own backend?


Treasury

	Unchained Capital vaults for the various needs like long term treasury, annual fund deposits, tuition deposits etc.
	Upgrade to the various new features as we grow and need more complex key management.
	
  
Symbiotic Beta Test Land for Developers
	Since we have a school with a great network and hundreds of potential users in a fairly controlled environment
	We are uniquely able to provide developers with a test bed to try stuff with a bunch of folks that will break your shit.
	We can find a way for devs to support the school a bit and the school will support the devs a bit.
	Kids get to be on the front lines of bitcoin development right on their own campus.
	Kids will getting exposed to this at a young age and will be the next gen devs coming up
	As a private school, we can work with folks in really creative ways that I'd too dopey to think of, but you will.
